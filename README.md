# Ride-hailing Android app
This project is a ride hailing Android application that allows users to either offer rides as drivers or join rides as passengers. The app features an integrated real-time map that displays live location updates of the rider throughout the trip.

Passengers can easily track the driverâ€™s progress and, at the end of the ride, indicate whether the rider arrived or did not arrive, ensuring a transparent and reliable experience for all users.

Here is a screen recording of the entire workflow of the application:
