This project is a ride hailing Android application that allows users to either offer rides as drivers or join rides as passengers. The app features an integrated real-time map that displays live location updates of the rider throughout the trip.

Passengers can easily track the driverâ€™s progress and, at the end of the ride, indicate whether the rider arrived or did not arrive, ensuring a transparent and reliable experience for all users.

Here is a screen recording of the entire workflow of the application:

### Build & Run Requirements
To successfully build and run this project, ensure that you have the following setup:
1) Android Studio: Narwhal (or newer)
2) Java Version: Java 21.0.6
3) Minimum Android SDK: API Level 24 (Android 7.0)

For the best **UI experience** and proper layout rendering, it is recommended to run the project using one of the following emulators:
1) Google Pixel 9 Pro Emulator (preferred)
2) Google Pixel 8 Pro Emulator
3) Google Pixel 7 Pro Emulator

### Architecture

While developing this application, I used the **Google recommended** [android app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture#recommended-app-arch) 
as a guideline to organize the code base into three distint layers: UI layer, Domain layer and Data layer.

The UI layer of the app is written completely in Jetpack Compose. There are no Fragments, only Composable screens.

### Module Structure

I also followed the **Google recommended** [modularization structure](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization/patterns#types-of-modules),
and I grouped the code base into three main modules: 
1) ```app```: This is the container module of the application. Its sole duty is to display all features of the application
2) ```core```: The core module serves as the base module. It contains code that can be resued across any part of the code base.
3) ```feature```: The feature module contains all features of the application.
